## Write Up

This assignment was overall very fun to work on as I got to have refresher with Go and its functionality. One thing that I would recommend this assignment to have to make it an "official assignment", is to also incorporate some testing suite to test the functionality of the functions being made. Also, one thing I was confused about in the documentation was whether we had to create a interface for the user or if just having the functions would be sufficient for the requirements.
